A blog publishing project I developed to share the developments and knowledge about the software and technology world.

### Project Content:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are 3 different authorizations in the project: reader, author and administrator. There are authentication and authorization processes to separate these authorizations. The author first registers to the administration panel. The registration process is notified to the administrator via e-mail. If the administrator deems appropriate, he/she approves the registration process through the panel. After the registration process is approved, the author can now log in to the panel and share valuable articles for readers ‚ò∫Ô∏è
